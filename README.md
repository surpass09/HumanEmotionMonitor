# üß† Human Emotion Prediction Model (WIP)

A deep learning project that detects **human emotions** from facial expressions using **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, and a layered CNN architecture. Built for fun, learning, and to push boundaries in human-centered AI.

## üöÄ Overview

This repo is a work-in-progress human emotion prediction model. The idea is simple: feed in an image of a face, and the model will tell you what emotion it sees ‚Äî happy, sad, angry, etc.

Currently using **CNNs** with **PyTorch**, but also experimenting with **TensorFlow/Keras** to test different architectures.

## üß† Model Architecture (Early Stage)

I'm stacking layers like this (in PyTorch):

```python
Conv2d ‚û° ReLU ‚û° BatchNorm ‚û° MaxPooling ‚û° Dropout
(Repeat 3-4x) ‚û° Flatten ‚û° Dense ‚û° Softmax
